# Laptop Price Prediction

A fully functional **end-to-end machine learning project** that predicts laptop prices based on specifications like RAM, processor, brand, and more. This project demonstrates the complete data science workflow ‚Äî from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training and deploying an interactive web application using **Streamlit**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project allows users to input laptop specifications and receive an estimated price prediction. It covers:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Transforming raw data into meaningful features for the model.  
- **Model Training:** Using machine learning algorithms to predict laptop prices accurately.  
- **Web Deployment:** Creating an interactive Streamlit app to make the model accessible to end-users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning Models)  
- **Streamlit** (Web App Deployment)  

## üìä Features
